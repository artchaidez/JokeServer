# JokeServer
  In this assignment you will build a pair of multi-threaded servers that accept input from multiple clients, and return appropriate output. In addition to the basic client-server model, you will also implement a secondary administration channel to your servers, and manually maintain the state of all conversations within your distributed application.
  Each aspect of the specifications requires you to solve a particular client-server problem while maintaining a conversation within a stateless protocol. The assignment is designed to give you general-purpose exposure to writing code for a client-server environment, and working with threads, neither of which is trivial.
  Your finished server is just for fun, but with minor changes it can serve as the basis for a real, viable, client-server application handling thousands of client conversations simultaneously.
Note that we will not make these servers thread-safe which is beyond the scope of this assignment.
